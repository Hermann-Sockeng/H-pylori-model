# Within-host model of H. pylori with dynamic gastric pH

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1164469283.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18739168)

This repository contains the Python implementation of the mathematical model described in the article:

> *Modeling the Impact of Dynamic Gastric pH on Helicobacter pylori Eradication and the Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance*

The code reproduces all numerical simulations and figures presented in the paper, including the four clinical scenarios and the pH‑dependent fitness landscapes.
